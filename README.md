TASEP-1D (Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process) one-dimensional simulation/visualization (2016)

I used this for undergraduate independent study projects in studying the NYC MTA's subway traffic.

stochastic time random walk, 1-dim and 2-dim (2012-2014)

This is supporting code for research on stochastic time random walks, written and modified with Michael Laufer over 2012-2014.
The grid code at the bottom (as in the TASEP visualization) is from https://forum.processing.org/beta/num_1195788276.html

Modify the mean for the best effect - compare mean zero versus nonzero.
